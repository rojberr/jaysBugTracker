## PLAN
How I went through construction phase:
Sprint planning: Sprints 1 week long

- [ ] Build SRS (Software Requirement Specification) and divide it in sprints
- [ ] Sprint 1 - ...
- [ ] Sprint 2
- [ ] Sprint 3
- [ ] Sprint 4
- [ ] Sprint 5
- [ ] Sprint 6
...

Check, draw conclusions (did I hit or miss the deadline, upgrade)


## PRODUCT BACKLOG / SRS
Prioritized list of specification requirements for my app:

Features that this app should have: ...
- take in a request (build website)
- take the address of and send it to ...
- when the ticket gets in gets saved
- ticket marked complete
- offline mode (SQL lite to work on device)
- web admin to look at all tickets
Benefits: ...

Because of job interview related reasons I'm planning to build this project accordingly:

1. It must be build using Design Patterns (MVC Patterns) for Java,
because of standardization, making develop, debug and maintain process easier.

2. Good clean, responsive UI,
at best utilize Bootstrap template and put it on my project.

3. Include database performing 'crud' (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

4. Includes Demo Logins (without the need to signup) page with authorization process, 
with f.e. admin rights and user rights >> at best utilize AuthO

5. Handles and implements security
